# Farkle

A six-sided, six die game.

## Instructions

Only single 1's and 5's are worth points. Other #'s count only if you get 3 or<br>
more of the same # in a single roll. Other combinations of #'s are worth points<br>
you get them in a single roll.

## Play

After each roll, set aside dice that are worth points & roll the rest of them.<br>
You must remove at least one die after each roll & keep a running total of your<br>
points for that turn. If you set aside all 6 dice you can roll them all again to<br>
build your running total. If you cannot set aside any dice after a roll, that's<br>
Farkle. You lose your running total of points for that turn, & play passes to the<br>
left. To score for the first time you must have a running total of 500 points<br>
before you stop rolling. After your first score of 500 points or more is<br>
recorded you can stop rolling & add your points to your running total. Once<br>
your points are entered on the score sheet they are safe & you cannot lose them.

## Winning

When a player's accumulated score is 10,000 or more.
